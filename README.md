A really really ~~annoying~~ fun Minecraft spigot plugin. 

## Feature  
### Better visual effects
Players spill bloody upon receiving damage  
Players spawn bubbles while drowning in the water

  
   
### More realistic player physics  
Head, body, arm, and leg have individual health  
Low head health causes player to go blind 
Low arm health causes player to deal reduced damage  
Low leg health causes player to run slower  

### Hydration Mechanics 
Player need to drink water or eat fruits to maintain the hydration level  
Low hydration level kills player slowly  


### Sanity Mechanics
Player loses sanity if stay in the dark for too long  
Low sanity causes player to see hallucination, and hear strange noises  
If the sanity reaches extremely low level, then it can trigger zombie apocalypse
